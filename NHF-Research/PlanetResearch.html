                    The planet is engulfed in darkness at all times, due to it's distance to the sun. The photon crystals on this planet seem to have been exhausted prematurely, and crystalline damage has been detected on the surface of a depleted crystal, suggesting that the photons of the crystals can be harvested and possibly used for power generation.

The planets exterior shows What could be clouds engulfing the planet which are white and thick that can be just Ash enveloping the Surface, The planet is also filled with rings making it possible for Rocks to tumble down on the planet.</p>

                <p>
                    Scans show low light levels. Cause: Distance to sun, thick planet atmosphere.
                    Most light on the planet is generated by these crystals of unknown origin.
                    The crystals dont seem to have a color themselves, rather they each emit light of a singular color frequency.
                    Samples show the crystals are made of mostly photons, carbon and sulphur, rendering them extremely volatile.
                    The crystals are now called Photon Crystals.
                    Furthermore, the crystals show to degrade over time when left outside of light for a long time.
                    This is odd, as this planet is far from the sun and the crystals thus don't get a lot of light.
                    Further research is recommended.
                    Example Photon Crystals.
