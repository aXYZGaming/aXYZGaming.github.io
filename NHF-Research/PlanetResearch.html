                <p>Sugnuhc 3 appears to be a Magma-Lava planet with no known Volcanic activity but is filled with lava pits and magma and rocks, The planet is Believed to be made up of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfure, The high temperatures can be explained due to it be close to a star. The planets exterior shows What could be clouds engulfing the planet which are white and thick that can be just Ash enveloping the Surface, The planet is also filled with rings making it possible for Rocks to tumble down on the planet.</p>

                <p>
                    Scans show low light levels. Cause: Distance to sun, thick planet atmosphere.
                    Most light on the planet is generated by these crystals of unknown origin.
                    The crystals dont seem to have a color themselves, rather they each emit light of a singular color frequency.
                    Samples show the crystals are made of mostly photons, carbon and sulphur, rendering them extremely volatile.
                    The crystals are now called Photon Crystals.
                    Furthermore, the crystals show to degrade over time when left outside of light for a long time.
                    This is odd, as this planet is far from the sun and the crystals thus don't get a lot of light.
                    Further research is recommended.
                    Example Photon Crystals.

                    Planet is entirely habitable, surface mostly covered in oceans. Grass as only life form.
                    Unusual proximity to black hole, increased graviton saturation in planet atmosphere and surface.

                    Atmosphere is made up of 70% N, 24% O2 and 6% CO2.
