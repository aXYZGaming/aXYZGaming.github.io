                <h4>Battlecruiser (2016-2017 design)</h4>
                <p>[Unknown Date, Space Log]</p>
                <p>
                    The Battlecruiser appears to have the same shape and form as the Destroyer the only difference is it using much more powerful Main Battery Cannons with [AA] Included into it making it even more powerful.. The ship includes 6 Main Battery Cannons, 22 Light Secondary Battery Cannons, 10 Heavy Secondary Battery Cannons, and last 24 Point Defense Cannons that appear to be similar to the Heavy Laser design but must be refitted with self-defense cannons. Ships location can be found in a destroyed Auto-Ship (See Below to see its older variant) at the cockpit next to the Drivers seat. By awakening the ship the Battleship that looks like it is destroyed would re-awaken and would turn on and automatically repair itself making it fully operational for war and battle. The ships rooms are the Following, Deck 3 is what appears to be Side entrances-exit rooms for the ship, Deck 2 is the Cafeteria area or weaponry room since it includes seats with a platform table and one replicator module, Deck 1 which includes the sensory room, Artillery room that includes three Artillery seat modules which allows you to control all of the ships weaponry along with a viewing area to the reactor room of the ship, Observation Deck which houses the transporter and a table with chairs and pretty much couldn't be called a observation room due to it having lack of windows, The Hanger room which includes a fighter spawner pad which can spawn anything that's related to a fighter or bomber accept for huge bombers, And Last the bridge including the Captains seat surrounded with Computers, a Artillery seat appearing to have old Artillery seat design, a Navigation's seat which includes a old seat design, and then other random seats that are pointing directly to a computer, another thing the Bridge includes is the Seats in the back and two doors That lead out to a outside area where you can walk around to see guns.
                    the ship has no known ladder accept for some blocky steep walkway which is very unsafe, the pathway connects to the other area which is the "Observation room", this now concludes the ship design and every intel I have about it.
                    The ships max speed is 79 std/s.
