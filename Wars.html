                <h2>The war against Zombie Slayers United</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Date: 29/3/2021
                </p>
                <br />
                <strong>This is the announcement that followed after the war was finished.</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                    New Haven is officially at peace with Zombie Slayers and will have a white peace, The battle resulted in a tie as Zombie took down our HQ but we rebelled and destroyed both of his stations and the Colony, The terms are to follow and everyona re to follow it or else it will lead to a blacklist or ban:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Zombie Slayers and New Haven Cannot Attack eacother  with a permanent ceasefire that bans the right for New Haven Fleet ships and Zombie Slayer fleet ships to attack each other
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Normal White Peace
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The treaty will be permanent and will never expire
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This treaty also marks the first white flag surrender but it would still count as a tie for both them and us.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                        This is the first Ever war of Starbase to occur from the Faction update and the treaty and small war shall be remembered for being the first conflict in Starbase from the Faction Update.
